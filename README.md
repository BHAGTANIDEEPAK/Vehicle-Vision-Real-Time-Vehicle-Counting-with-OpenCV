# Introduction
Vehicle Vision is a Python-based project designed to count vehicles in real-time using OpenCV and video footage. By utilizing computer vision techniques, this project can track moving vehicles and provide precise counts, making it suitable for various applications such as traffic monitoring, congestion analysis, and smart transportation systems.

### Features
Real-time vehicle counting from video streams
Works with pre-recorded videos and live camera feeds
Uses OpenCV for motion detection, tracking, and counting
Adjustable detection parameters for custom scenarios
Easily extendable for vehicle classification and tracking
### Use Cases
Traffic Monitoring: Analyze traffic flow and monitor congestion in urban areas.
Surveillance Systems: Integrate with smart city surveillance to detect and count vehicles.
Traffic Violation Detection: Use in combination with other techniques for detecting rule violations (e.g., speeding).
Data Analysis: Gather traffic data for analytics and prediction models in transportation studies.
